STM32 based quadcopter project
-------------------------------

This is a hobby quadcopter/drone project built almost from scratch. It is written in C programming language.
below are the other technical specification

1. STM32F100RB microcontroller (STM32VLdiscovery board)
2. FreeRTOS
3. GY-87 
    a. MPU6050(accelerometer + gyro)
    b. HMC5883L(magnetometer) 
    c. BMP180(Barometric pressure sensore)
4. madgwick filter (initilally I wrote the attitude estimation filter myself but since I was not 
   a mechanical/aeronotical engineer I couldn't create a reliable filter. So I had to switch to a 
   professional off-the-shelf filter)
5. The project was developed on the Atollic TrueStudio 9.0.1(This version supports the 
   stlink-V1 on this old discovery board and thus debugging is possible through SWD).
6. Doxygen style documentation comments are provided.
